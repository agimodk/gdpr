    'paragraph_3' => 'Technical cookies are needed for the website to work properly. Our website is coded in Laravel, which makes it easy to protect us from cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks. Cross-site request forgeries are a type of malicious exploit whereby unauthorized commands are performed on behalf of an authenticated user. Laravel automatically generates a CSRF "token" for each active user session managed by the application. This token is used to verify that the authenticated user is the one actually making the requests to the application. Laravel stores the current CSRF token in a XSRF-TOKEN cookie that is included with each response generated by the framework. You can use the cookie value to set the X-XSRF-TOKEN request header. This cookie is primarily sent as a convenience since some JavaScript frameworks and libraries, like Angular and Axios, automatically place its value in the X-XSRF-TOKEN header.
                        All the session information is stored in our second cookie called "NAME". These are both autogenarated by Laravel, not by us. Read more about Laravel´s technical cookies <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/5.7/session"><u>here</u></a>.',
